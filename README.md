This mini project aims to provide gas-free NFT minting on the Polygon Layer 2 network to
address the high gas fee issue faced by Ethereum-based NFTs. By leveraging Polygon's faster
and cheaper transactions, creators can mint their digital assets more efficiently and
cost-effectively, making it more accessible for everyone. This project will facilitate the
growth of the NFT ecosystem by reducing the barriers to entry for creators, investors, and
collectors.
Gasless NFT is a decentralized application (Dapp) built on top of the Polygon network that allows users to mint NFTs without paying any gas fees.
